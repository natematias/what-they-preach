# What They Preach: Comparative Visualization of Church Sermons
What would we learn by comparing the texts and teachings of an entire religion across culture and language?

In 2012, I asked this question by [visualizing the sermon texts from two churches](http://natematias.com/medialab/what-they-preach/), one in the UK and one in the US. 

I've written here about [comparing the use of religious texts across cultures](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/measuring-what-they-preach-comparing-religious-sermons-across-cultures).
